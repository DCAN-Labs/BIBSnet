**Please visit the [BIBSNet webpage](https://bibsnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for comprehensive documentation (including background information, installation and usage instructions, etc) and the [BIBSNet dockerhub Repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dcanumn/bibsnet/) to download the container.**

We introduce BIBSNet (Baby and Infant Brain Segmentation Neural Network), an open-source, community-driven deep learning model. Provided as a [BIDS App](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/about/) container, BIBSNet leverages data augmentation and a large, manually annotated infant dataset to produce robust and generalizable brain segmentations. The model outputs native-space brain segmentations, brain masks, and sidecar JSON files as [BIDS derivatives](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/derivatives/introduction.html).
