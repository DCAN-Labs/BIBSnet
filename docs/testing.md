# Testing
To test BIBSNet to ensure it's working as expected, please do the following:

### Download Test Data

Install `openneuro-py` on the command line (e.g. `pip install openneuro-py`) and use it to download test data from [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/), e.g.: 
```
# Python
from pathlib import Path
import openneuro

Path("./ds004776").mkdir()
openneuro.download(dataset="ds004776", target_dir="./ds004776", include="sub-01")
```
### Execute BIBSNet

If you haven't already, build the BIBSNet container locally as described [here](usage.md#option-1-execute-as-container-recommended-for-general-user) and execute with the test data, e.g.:
```
# bash

mkdir derivatives

singularity run --nv --cleanenv --no-home \
	-B /path/to/ds004776:/input \
	-B /path/to/derivatives:/output \
	/path/to/bibsnet.sif \
	/input /output participant \
	-participant 01 \
```

### Confirm Successful Execution

The logs outputs will indicate whether the application ran successfully or not like so:
```
# Successful log output:
The pipeline took this long to run successfully: <time>

# Unsuccessful log output:
The pipeline took this long to run and then crashed: <time>

```

If it was successful, you should also see all of the expected outputs produced (see [Outputs](outputs.md)). For good measure, visually inspect the segmentation generated. Here is a snapshot view of the brain segmentation generated by this test subject:
