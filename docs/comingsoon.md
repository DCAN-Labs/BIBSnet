### Multiple Anatomical Images of the Same Modality in the BIDS Inputs

At present, CABINET is unable to operate if there are two or more T1w or T2w images present in the BIDS input anat directories. To use CABINET (and subsequent processing steps), it is advisable to eliminate the lower quality run from the BIDS inputs. We plan to add functionality to select the first T1w or T2w image in the near future, with averaging implemented at a later stage.
